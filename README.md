# The `BNPvegan` R package - :warning: Under development

This **R** package is an implementation of various Bayesian nonparametric models for the analysis of ecological data. The **R** package is currently under development. The package consists of two main methods: **species sampling models** (`ssm`) and  **species discovery models** (`sdm`).

The `BNPvegan` package can be installed by running the following commands:

```r 
# If the devtools R package is not already installed
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("alessandrozito/BNPvegan")
```

For a description of the two class of models and the associated functions, please refer to the [BNPvegan package documentation](https://alessandrozito.github.io/BNPvegan/vignette.html)
