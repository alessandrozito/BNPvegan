## Species sampling models (`ssm` class)

Species sampling models are a Bayesian nonparametric tools that have a large variety of applications in ecology. For a general overview, one can refer to:

* De Blasi, P., Favaro, S., Lijoi, A., Mena, R.H., Pruenster, I., Ruggiero, M.: (2015): [Are Gibbs-type priors the most natural generalization of the Dirichlet process?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00163), *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence* **37**(2), 212-229.

As a working example, we make use of the frequencies available in the `data("Lepidoptera")` dataset. The sampling scheme currently availabe are the Dirichlet process `DP` and the Pitman-Yor process `PY`.
