# Sequential discovery models (class `sdm`)

Sequential discovery models are a Bayesian method to construct, fit and predict the accumulation curves arising from the frequencies with which species are observed. For a theoretical description, see:

 * Zito, A., Rigon, T., Ovaskainen, O. and Dunson, D. B. (2020+): [Bayesian nonparametric modelling of sequential discoveries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06629)
 
The models available for the latent variables are the three-parameter log-logistic distribution (`"LL3"`, *the default*) and the Weibull distribution (`"Weibull"`). Both methods assume that the total number of species observable in the sample is always finite.
